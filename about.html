            <p>I joined a team of 4 which took a startup from just an idea to trading in markets, meet Ethical Beans!</p> 
            <p>This coffee startup became an incredible project, where I did all sorts of tasks even including flying out to Amsterdam to meet suppliers!</p>

            <p>I graduated with a 2:1 in History from Coventry University this year</p> 
             <p>It was an amazing 3 years full of learning and a ton of new experiences!</p>

          <p>I taught myself Guitar and Ukulele and am still going strong after two years! It's a great creative outlet and fantastic for making lockdown that much more enjoyable!</p>

          <p>I love boxing! the fitness and discipline it requires is really inspiring and nothing pushed your body like it! Admittedly Covid 19 has put a temporary stop to it; but I am itching to get back in the gym!</p>

          <p>It's a funny thing to enter the world of coding, which relies on staying on the cutting edge, from History which is literally about staying in the past. </p> 
           
          <p>But for me it's a logical first step, getting invaluble skills and starting off my journey down a fantastic career path!</p> 
          <p>I'm hoping to get a runing start into the industry though this course and meet lots of great people!</p> 
          <p>I can't wait to get started!</p>
